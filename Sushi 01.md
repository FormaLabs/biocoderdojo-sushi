# BioCoderDojo Sushi #1: Fruit DNA Extraction

## Introduction
DNA is present in all living things. It is the language of life, a molecule that
carries a code. That code instructs the individual cells that make us, and all
other living things, how to work together to make us what we are.

Before we can read, study, or edit DNA, we need to first get our hands on the
stuff (unless someone's already done all of this and uploaded it somewhere handy!).
This 'sushi' experiment explores how to extract DNA from a plentiful and easy to
access source: soft fruits, in this case Strawberry.

You can actually do this on spittle, as well, if you feel like collecting lots
and lots of your own spit. But the strawberry is less gruesome!

## How this works
DNA is a long chemical, and consists of two strands of "bases" (the "letters" of
DNA, 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T') strung along a back-bone that has an electric
charge. The strength of the letters of one strand binding to their partner-letters
on the other strand ('A' likes to bind to 'T', and 'G' likes to bind to 'C')
keeps them stuck together tightly even though the electrical charges of either
strand would otherwise push them apart.

When you follow the instructions below, you first break open all of the cells in
the strawberry flesh by blending them finely, and then adding detergent (which
dissolves their fatty cell-membranes that protect them from the surrounding water).

You then add table salt, also known chemically as Sodium Chloride. The Sodium
ions have an electrical charge that's opposite to the DNA, so they bind to DNA
and allow the different double-stranded lengths of DNA to get closer to one
another, by "hiding" their charge from one another.

Then, when you add the alcohol, the DNA and sodium can clump together and "escape"
the water by forming large knots. As they clump together and float upwards, they
become visible, and you see the white, clumpy DNA clots.

Because DNA and sodium become very sticky, you can sometimes use a glass rod,
certain plastics, or a wooden toothpick to scoop and spool the DNA together on
the tip of something small, and lift them out of the solution. You could, if you
liked, try then to put the DNA into a fresh tube of deionised water, and re-dissolve
it. This could be the first step in purifying DNA for something more grand, like
learning to edit it, or even making your own Genetically Engineered things with it!

## How to extract DNA from soft fruit
You'll need:

* Soft fruit, ideally strawberries, preferably not bananas.
* Dishwashing detergent such as fairy concentrate.
* Table salt.
* Rubbing Alcohol, preferably 95% or higher (have your parents ask at a pharmacy, and **don't drink it, it's deadly (really)**)
* A sieve or "French Press"/Cafetiere coffee press.
* A coffee filter to filter the fruit pulp (not essential, but..)
* A clean, unscratched glass

Steps:

1. Mash or blend up the fruit as finely as possible, then add as much water as
    have fruit to make it 2x as large.
2. Let the results settle for a while, then pour the clearer liquid through the
    sieve or press it in the coffee filter to get rid of most of the gunk.
3. Add some detergent to this mix; for a glass, add a few drops, for a whole blender
    (how much DNA do you need??) add around 30ml. Mix this in with a spoon, blending
    detergent mightn't end well for you.
4. Let the results setle for a while and then pour through the coffee filter slowly
    to get rid of the rest of the gunk.
5. The clear liquid at the end contains all the bits of the burst-open cells,
    including proteins, carbohydrates, fats and oils, and..DNA. To get it ready
    for purification, add some salt; a generous pinch for a glass, or 5g for a blender.
    Stir this to dissolve it in.
6. In an un-scratched glass, slowly pour some alcohol along a spoon touching the
    side of the glass so that it settles into a layer on top of the clear, salty
    fruit-pulp. This layer should be about a centimeter or more thick to make things
    clearly visible.
7. Watch, amazed and mind-blown, as the DNA appears along the boundary as a white
    mist, and (if there was enough DNA in the fruit/spit) forms a white clot.
8. (Optional): Try using a wooden toothpick to extract the DNA!
9. (Optional): Can you re-dissolve the DNA in fresh water, preferably de-ionised?
