# BioCoderDojo Sushi

CoderDojo makes use of templated "beginner's experiments" for computer code to help
boot-strap new CoderDojos easily and get peer groups up to speed. For BioCoderDojo,
we aim to create a similar repository of useful experiments that kids and adults can
explore together to build a base-line of knowledge that can evolve organically into
a peer-learning phenomemon.

We eagerly accept new "sushi" expressing beginners' introductions to biology topics,
either use github and issue a Pull Request with your changes, or (if you don't know
how to use Git yet) open an "Issue" with the new Sushi. Sushis should be expressed
in Pandoc-flavoured Markdown and introduce core concepts in a fun, lightweight way,
and include a short and simple "how-to", preferably engineered to remove unnecessary
or difficult-to-source equipment and ingredients.

Take these, hack them, share them widely! They're Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike,
and all PRs must be licensed similarly (no more restrictive, no less).
